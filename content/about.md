Hi, I’m Tal. I build products and teams at the intersection of applied machine learning and customer outcomes. I’ve founded and sold companies, shipped ML-heavy systems, and coach teams on bringing rigor to experiments without losing momentum.

These days you’ll find me splitting time between Berlin and the internet, writing about product leadership, execution, and the craft of building thoughtful tools. When I’m not working, I’m learning how to be a better dad, partner, and climber.
