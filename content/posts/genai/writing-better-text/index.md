I've been using Anki, a spaced repition app to learn German. It worked really well and I wondered if I could use it to teach my five year old son to read. 
Turns out I'm not the first one to think about this, and I found a Reddit post from a  guy who has taught his kids to [read using Anki][1]. 
  
I decided to give this a try as well and of course had to make the scope broader by also generating the letters of the alphabet with Dalle3. The idea being that my son could see pictures of things he knows with the letter they start with and thus associate the relevant phoneme or sound with the letter.
