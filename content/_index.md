Thanks for stopping by. I'm Tal, Israeli, father of 2, beloved and loving partner.  I live in Berlin. I have ADHD and was formally diagnosed a few years ago, it's become a point of introspection.

I've spent my career in ML tooling and it's impact on organizations. I built LightTag, a text annotation tool and company, which I eventually sold to Primer.

At Primer, I drove the adoption of Triton inference server as a model server. The success of a technological solution depends on cultural integration as much as on technical integration.

These days, I am particularly interested in the interplay of combinatorial solvers like MIP and SAT with LLMs.
