Thanks for stopping by. I'm Tal, Israeli, father of 2, beloved and loving partner.  I live in Berlin.

I've spent my career in ML tooling and it's impact on organizations. In the last few years, I built LightTag, a text annotation tool and company, which I eventually sold to Primer. I've also worked at Citi, was CTO of Superfly and had my first job doing low latency C++ for finance.

At Primer, I drove the adoption of Triton inference server as a model server. The success of a technological solution depends on cultural integration as much as on technical integration.

In tech, something that I'm very curious about is the interplay of solvers and verification methods with LLMs.  I like explaining things, and am sometimes good at explaining them to myself and others, which seems be working for me as I explain more and more to my AI overlords.
